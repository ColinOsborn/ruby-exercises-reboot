class Clearance

  def initialize
    # @cart = {}
  end

  def best_deal
    for some cases, we want to return nil
    when there is an item we want to return the first argument when instantiating a new item
  end

  def <<(item)
    item will be an item object (an instance of item)
    it seems to me like we want support a collection of items
    this method will directly affect best_deal
  end


  # def <<(item)
  #   @cart << item
  # end
end
